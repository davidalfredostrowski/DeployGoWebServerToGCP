If you just want to get through the deployment and don't care scaling, the following might help.

try to delete all versions and instances as many as possible, and remember to repeat deletion multiple times because deletion might fail.
in your app.yaml, limit the instance number to just 1 instance, and then try to deploy again.
manual_scaling:
  instances: 1
